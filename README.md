# RECAPTCHA COMMENT FORM

## ABOUT
- A live demo for this repository is available [here](https://recaptcha-submission-form.hillert.dev).
- This was a take-home challenge I completed when applying for my first front-end developer role.
- The red square in the upper right hand corner indicates the recaptcha status (it does not close the modal).
- When the red indicator returns green, it means the recaptcha believes the user is a human.

## TO RUN LOCALLY
